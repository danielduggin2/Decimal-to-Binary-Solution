# Building a Decimal-to-Binary Converter with JavaScript

Let's delve into the fundamental concepts of recursion, explore the call stack, and create a visual representation of the recursion process through an animation. These concepts are essential for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems.

## Project Overview

In this project, you'll embark on building a decimal-to-binary converter using JavaScript. The project covers fundamental concepts such as:

- Understanding and implementing recursion.
- Exploring the call stack and how it operates with recursive functions.
- Building a visual representation of the recursion process.
- Animating the recursion steps to enhance comprehension.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Recursion**: How a function can call itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem.
- **Call Stack**: Understanding how the call stack works, particularly with recursive function calls.
- **Base Case and Recursive Case**: Identifying and implementing the base case to end recursion and the recursive case to continue the process.
- **Visual Representation**: Creating an animation to visually depict each step of the recursion process, aiding in better understanding of how recursion unwinds.
